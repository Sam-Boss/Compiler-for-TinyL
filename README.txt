READMEThis is a project for my Principles of Programming Languages class. C code which I wrote can be found in the files Compiler.c, StrengthReduction.c, ConstFolding.c, InstrUtils.c underneath comments that say YOUR CODE GOES HERE. The point of the project was to implement a recursive descent LL(1) parser that compiles inputs into a tinyL language. Then, the tinyL language can be optimized through a peephole optimizer using constant folding or operator strength reduction. Further information can be found in the file proj1.pdf.
